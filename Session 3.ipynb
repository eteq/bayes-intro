    "In principle we, don't. Back when astronomy \"computers\" were a [group of women working at Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers), and honestly well into the digital computer age, analytic techniques were the only practical way to do Bayesian Inference. This tends to revolve around specific statistical distributions where if you choose magical forms for $ \\mathscr{L}$ and $\\pi$, you get a $\\mathscr{P}$ with the same functional form as $\\pi$.  Thus are called \"conjugates\" - i.e. a given likelihood function has a particular \"conjugate prior\". You can see a [nicely formatted table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Table_of_conjugate_distributions) of these on wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble with this is threefold: \n",
    "1. These really only work for fairly trivial likelihoods, like pure Gaussians, Binomials, single Poisson processes, etc. So any real physical model is generally right out.\n",
    "2. You are *forced* by math to use a specific form of prior, so if your subjective prior belief doesn't follow that form, you're SOL.\n",
    "3. Historically, [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) would shout at you if you did this, and say you should use frequentist techniques instead because they were more practically applicable (true at the time)."

    "Given the limitations of analytic methods, we need a way to somehow characterize $\\mathscr{P}(\\Theta| D_i, M)$ numerically. Bayesian Inference really came into its own with the recognition that methods developed from statistical mechanics can solve this problem. One key realization is that for parameter distributions you don't necessarily *need* to solve for $Z$. It's independent of all the $\\Theta$s, so it's sufficient to say \"if I get a bunch of samples from this distribution, I can just normalize by dividing by the number of samples\".  It is exactly this problem that Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) codes are good at."
